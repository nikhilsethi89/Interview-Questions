why interested in fb?
 - Data & powerful tools - the size of data you guys work with is insane. just think about what insights you can get from such a rich data source
Data swarm is awesome. The best thing I liked about is ability to integate with Chronos so that the tasks can be distributed

- Scale - More than a billion customers. you help make their lives much better

- Culture at FB (autonomy of projects, people, mentality of go build it if not already there,ownership of work
- bootcamp
